        <h4>Heating and Cooling</h4>
        <h3>Consider these tips to curtail your heating and cooling costs.</h3>
        <section>
          <p>1. Refresh Your Air Filter</p>
          <p>Replacing a dirty air filter is probably the simplest, most inexpensive and most often overlooked maintenance job there is. Replace or clean your air filter once a month for fresher air and a more efficient heating and cooling system.</p>

          <p>2. Adjust Your Thermostat</p>
          <p>Get in the habit of leaving your thermostat at a constant temperature. During the summer, try 78° or above; in the winter, try 68° or below.If you change the temperature throughout the day, you are more likely to waste energy.</p>

          <p>3. Use Efficient Equipment</p>
          <p>Even the best insulated home will waste energy unless special attention is given to the efficiency of its mechanical equipment. Have your equipment checked by a qualified dealer each year before the heating or cooling season begins.</p>

          <p>4. Be a Fan of Your Fan</p>
          <p>Fans can be used in conjunction with air conditioning to help reduce energy costs. The "wind chill" effect allows you to set the thermostat slightly higher while maintaining the same degree of comfort in the room. Most ceiling fans are also designed to be reversible for winter operation, to direct the warmer air back down toward the floor level. </p>

        <h4>In the Kitchen</h4>
        <h3>Because it contains appliances that are used daily, the kitchen is a good place to manage energy.</h3>
        <section>
          <p>1. Use Your Dishwasher &mdash; Efficiently</p>
          <p>Washing and rinsing dishes by hand three times a day uses more hot water and energy than one load a day in an automatic dishwasher. But make sure you&apos;re being smart with your dishwasher:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Read your owners manual and make sure you are loading dishes properly to avoid blocking the dispenser and spray arms, and that you are using the proper amount of detergent.</li>
          <li>Don&apos;t overload your dishwasher. Always use the shortest cycle that will clean your dishes, and take advantage of partial-load cycles and other special features for better energy use.</li>
          <li>On hot days, wait to use your dishwasher until night to avoid adding heat in the house.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>2. Choose a High-Efficiency Refrigerator or Freezer</p>
          <p>Look for these features when buying a new refrigerator or freezer:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>A high-efficiency motor</li>
          <li>Improved or thicker insulation (polyurethane foam or fiberglass)</li>
          <li>Low estimated kilowatt-hour (kWh) usage per month</li>
          <li>The smallest unit to meet your needs</li>
          </ul>

          <p>3. Then Make Sure Your Refrigeration Appliance Operates Efficiently</p>
          <p>Locate your appliance on a level surface, away from heat sources and direct sunlight, and provide adequate clearance all around for good air circulation. For the best operation:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Keep your refrigerator's temperature between 37° and 40° and your freezer's setting at 0°.</li>
          <li>Keep condenser coils and door gaskets clean.</li>
          <li>Don&apos;t overload with too much food, and cover all liquids.</li>
          <li>Don&apos;t open the door, or keep it open, more than needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>4.  Cook Up Some Energy Savings</p>
          <p>You don&apos;t have to be a master chef to cook like an energy pro:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Use one oven to prepare the entire meal. For example, a pie can go into the oven as a main dish is removed.</li>
          <li>Warming foods, plates and platters with the oven's stored heat after baking, requires no energy. If the food must be kept warm for an extended period of time, set the oven no higher than 140° to 200°.</li>
          <li>Cook by time and temperature, resisting the urge to open the oven door to check on progress. The temperature drops 25° to 50° each time the door is opened.</li>
          <li>Consider using a microwave, toaster oven, or other small appliance instead of the oven. These use about one-third the power of an oven broiler.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Around the House</h4>
        <h3>Learn various tips and tricks to keep energy use low around your home, from using hot water wisely to saving energy on appliance use.</h3>
        <section>
          <p>1. Using Hot Water Wisely</p>
          <p>Your water heater is the second-largest energy user in your home. Here are some tips to curtail your hot water consumption:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Use your sink stopper. Closing the sink drain when shaving or hand washing dishes will save gallons of hot water.</li>
          <li>Equip your shower with a flow control or regulator to reduce water volume while increasing pressure. Look for these devices at your local hardware store.</li>
          <li>Repair dripping faucets and save water, energy and money. Dripping faucets overwork the water heater, erode valve seats and often cause ugly sink stains. </li>
          <li>Turn down the thermostat on your water heater to 140°, 120° if you don't use a dishwasher.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>2. Washer Wisdom</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Cold water cleans many fabrics and soils just as well as warm water. Heavily soiled fabrics may require hot water.</li>
          <li>Don't use too much soap. Oversudsing makes your washer work harder and may require a second wash to remove excess soap.</li>
          <li>Try to wash full loads whenever possible. It takes as much energy to wash a single item as it takes to wash a full load.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>3. Energy-Saving Ideas for Your Dryer</p>
          <p>Never use more heat than you need, and remember that excessive heat can damage some fabrics. Dry loads of clothes immediately after one another. With the dryer already warm, you won't waste energy bringing it back up to the desired temperature level. Other suggestions:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Locate your dryer where it has access to fresh air. Humid air increases drying time and energy costs.</li>
          <li>Separate loads into heavy and lightweight items.</li>
          <li>Clean the lint filter after each use to maximize airflow and efficiency.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>4. No-Waste Lighting</p>
          <p>Installing efficient bulbs is just the start. Here are more good habits to adopt to save energy on lighting:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Turn off lights that aren&apos;t being used. </li>
          <li>Buy lamps with three-way switches and install dimmers for overhead lighting so you can lower the settings when less light is required.</li>
          <li>Use night-lights, which are low wattage, instead of leaving larger-wattage hall or room lights on at night.</li>
          <li>Open drapes on south-facing windows during winter daylight hours to get "free" light and heat.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <h4>Seasonal Tips</h4>
        <h3>When seasons change, so do the most effective ways to save energy.</h3>
        <section>
          <p>There are many things you can do to make you and your home more comfortable in the winter:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Use an electric blanket at night &mdash; it&apos;s more economical than heating the entire house all night long.</li>
          <li>Use the reverse setting on your ceiling fan to push hot air from the ceiling to the occupied areas of the room.</li>
          <li>Keep cold wind outside by closing garage doors.</li>
          <li>Close all louvers and vents in the attic or foundation walls during the winter &mdash; but be sure to open them when the weather turns warm.</li>
          <li>If you use portable electric heaters, use them only in small areas. Buy models that are thermostatically controlled.</li>
          <li>Make sure heating outlets and return air registers are not blocked by furniture, draperies, doors or other obstacles.</li>
          <li>Leave draperies open on sunny days so your house will absorb the sun's heat. Close them on the shaded side of the house and at night.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Energy-Saving Projects</h4>
        <h3>Find inexpensive DIY projects to complete around the house.</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Most local building supply stores stock a variety of insulation, caulking and weather stripping products. And it really is amazing how these little energy-efficiency upgrades can add up to big energy savings.</p>

          <p class="important-info">1. Attic Insulation</p>
          <p>Most older homes don&apos;t have enough insulation. Adding or increasing attic insulation is a great way to increase your home's energy efficiency and comfort level, and save up to 30% on your heating and cooling costs.</p>

          <p class="important-info">2. Caulking</p>
          <p>Sealing air leaks is another great way to increase energy efficiency. Caulking should be applied wherever two different materials or parts of the house meet. It is available in a variety of forms. Select the caulk best-suited for the part of the house you are improving.</p>

          <p class="important-info">3. Weather Stripping</p>
          <p>Weather-stripping also helps prevent leaks. It can be purchased by the foot or in kit form, and there is a special kind for double doors, which often are hung with a substantial gap where they meet so the doors can swing freely. For the bottom of a door you may want to use something called a "door sweep."</p>

          <p>You have some choices to make when it comes to weather stripping also. You may need spring-metal, rolled-vinyl or adhesive-backed weather stripping, depending on the type of windows and doors you have.</p>
