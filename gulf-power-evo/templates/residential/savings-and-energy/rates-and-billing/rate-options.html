        <h3>Standard Rate</h3>
        <p>The standard residential rate is our most common rate for customers. On top of the monthly base charge, you are charged a flat rate per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy and fuel used. No discounts are provided for managing your energy use. Note that applicable sales tax and other fees may be billed in addition to these charges.</p>

        <p>Customers who enroll in our <a href="/residential/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/energy-select">Energy <span class="select">Select</span> program</a> pay the Residential Service Variable Pricing, or RSVP, rate. This rate allows Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customers to pay a lower price for their electricity 87% of the time by taking control and managing their energy use.</p>

            <h3>RSVP Rate Details</h3>
            <p>The RSVP rate features four variable prices that are based upon the time of day and time of week, with time periods that vary by season (summer and winter). By responding to different prices, Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customers have the opportunity, 87% of the time, to buy electricity at a price lower than the standard residential rate.</p>
            <p class="disclaimer">Price Per Kilowatt-Hour (kWh)*</p>
            <p>Low: 8.3 cents</p>
            <p>Medium: 9.6 cents</p>
            <p>High: 17.0 cents</p>
            <p>Critical: 67.7 cents</p>
            <p>Standard Residential Rate: 11.4 cents</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p class="disclaimer">*Includes fuel charge. Excludes any applicable taxes.</p>
            <p>With the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> system, you can program your central cooling and heating system, electric water heater and pool pump to run more in the lower price periods and less, or not at all in the higher price periods. It's always your choice, and you are always in control.</p>
            <p>The low, medium and high price periods are set. You will always know when they are and can program your thermostat accordingly. The critical price period is not set and is determined by Gulf Power as needed. However, you can even plan for this price event by programming your thermostat and appliances to respond accordingly if and when the critical price signal is sent. You never have to be home to respond to any price. Once you program your settings, the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> system does the work for you.</p>

        <h3>Demand Rate</h3>
        <p>The Demand rate encourages you to save by limiting the simultaneous use of major appliances. With the Demand rate, the base charge and energy charge are reduced but there is an additional demand charge based on the maximum amount of energy you use at one time during the billing period. Use fewer appliances together to create less demand and enjoy more savings. </p>

            <h3>Breaking Down the Demand Rate</h3>
            <p>If you used all of the following appliances at one time, your total demand would be 10 kilowatts:</p>
            <p>Air conditioner........4 kilowatts</p>
            <p>Clothes dryer ...........5 kilowatts</p>
            <p>Pool pump ................1 kilowatt</p>
            <p>Total demand...........10 kilowatts</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Your total demand of 10 kilowatts from this time would be subject to the demand charge. However, if you can avoid running appliances at the same time &mdash; for example, drying your clothes when the pool pump isn&apos;t running &mdash; then your total demand will be less. </p>
            <p>Appliances used separately:</p>
            <p>8:00 a.m.......Air conditioner</p>
            <p>4 kilowatts total demand</p>
            <p>7:00 p.m.......Clothes dryer</p>
            <p>5 kilowatts total demand</p>
            <p>1:00 a.m........Pool pump</p>
            <p>1 kilowatt total demand</p>
            <p>By following the example above, your demand charge would be based on 5 kilowatts. This translates to savings for you and less demand on the power grid.</p>

        <h3>Time of Use Rate</h3>
        <p>With the Time of Use Rate, you save money on your power bill by managing the time of day that your home uses the most electricity. We can produce electricity for a lower cost when demand is low, and pass on these savings to you during off-peak hours.</p>

            <h3>Taking Advantage of the Time of Use Rate</h3>
            <p>Time of Use is a rate that offers off-peak pricing periods (evenings, nights and weekends) when Gulf Power customers&apos; electricity usage is at its lowest and Gulf Power can produce electricity at a lower cost.</p>
            <p>Shifting your energy use away from the on-peak time periods (May-November weekday afternoons and November-April weekday mornings) can save you money and energy.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Here are some ways to shift energy use:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a programmable thermostat to increase the temperature in your home to 78-80 degrees during summer weekdays.</li>
              <li>Avoid using major appliances such as ovens, clothes washers, dryers and dishwashers during the peak time period.</li>
              <li>Use a timer on your pool pump so that it runs overnight and automatically shuts off.</li>
              <li>Increase the use of ceiling fans to keep you comfortable when you are home.</li>
              <li>Use a timer on your water heater.</li>
