        <h3>Standard Rate</h3>
        <p>The standard residential rate is our most common rate for customers. On top of the monthly base charge, you are charged a flat rate per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy and fuel used. No discounts are provided for managing your energy use. Note that applicable sales tax and other fees may be billed in addition to these charges.</p>

            <h3>RSVP Rate Details</h3>
            <p>The RSVP rate features four variable prices that are based upon the time of day and time of week, with time periods that vary by season (summer and winter). By responding to different prices, Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customers have the opportunity, 87% of the time, to buy electricity at a price lower than the standard residential rate.</p>
            <p class="disclaimer">Price Per Kilowatt-Hour (kWh)*</p>
            <p>Low: 8.3 cents</p>
            <p>Medium: 9.6 cents</p>
            <p>High: 17.0 cents</p>
            <p>Critical: 67.7 cents</p>

            <p class="disclaimer">*Includes fuel charge. Excludes any applicable taxes.</p>
            <p>With the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> system, you can program your central cooling and heating system, electric water heater and pool pump to run more in the lower price periods and less, or not at all in the higher price periods. It's always your choice, and you are always in control.</p>
            <p>The low, medium and high price periods are set. You will always know when they are and can program your thermostat accordingly. The critical price period is not set and is determined by Gulf Power as needed. However, you can even plan for this price event by programming your thermostat and appliances to respond accordingly if and when the critical price signal is sent. You never have to be home to respond to any price. Once you program your settings, the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> system does the work for you.</p>
