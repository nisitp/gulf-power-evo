      <p>Your power bill is calculated according to your rate and the amount of electricity your household has used. Seems simple enough, but when you look at your monthly bill you might still wonder how it all adds up. To start, here are a few key principles to remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Energy use is measure by the kilowatt hour (kWh), which equals 1,000 watts</li>
        <li>How long you use electricity matters</li>
        <li>The strength in wattage of your bulbs, appliances, etc. also matters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words &mdash; the more things you have turned on at the same time, and the longer you run them, the higher your bill will be. Read on for more information to help you better understand rates, billing and payment.</p>
