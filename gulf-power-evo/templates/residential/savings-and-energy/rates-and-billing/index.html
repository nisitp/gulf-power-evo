      <p>Your power bill is calculated according to your rate and the amount of electricity your household has used. Seems simple enough, but when you look at your monthly bill you might still wonder how it all adds up. To start, here are a few key principles to remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A kilowatt hour, abbreviated kWh, is a measurement of energy used.</li>
        <li>This system of measurement uses the metric system. So a kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts.</li>
        <li>Watts and kilowatts are measured with watt hours and kilowatt hours. This is how much electricity is consumed over the given course of an hour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, if a 100 watt light bulb runs for 10 hours a day, at the end of each day this light bulb would have consumed one kilowatt hour of energy. 100 watts times 10 equals 1 kilowatt.</p>
      <p>In other words &mdash; the more things you have turned on at the same time, and the longer you run them, the higher your bill will be. Read on for more information to help you better understand rates, billing and payment.</p>
