  <h2>How a Cool Roof Helps You Save</h2>
  <div>
    <section class="text-section basic-section">
      <p>According to ENERGY STAR, &ldquo;solar reflectance is the most important characteristic of a roof product in terms of yielding the highest energy savings during warmer months.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Reflective roof products come in more than one form &mdash; from roof coverings and tiles to paints and PVC sheets. Another bonus is that these products protect your roof. Your roof will last longer, which increases the overall eco-friendliness of your home.</p>
