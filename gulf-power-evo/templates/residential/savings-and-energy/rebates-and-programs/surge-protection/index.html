    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>Why do I need surge protection?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Power strips aren&apos;t enough to protect your home&apos;s technology. Our surge protection plans provide whole-house coverage and serve as your home&apos;s first line of defense against lightning-related or other damaging surges.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Why get surge protection from Gulf Power?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>We offer high quality, properly applied surge protection devices that afford the ultimate in total equipment protection. Most point-of-use devices sold in stores provide limited protection to only those devices plugged into them. We will provide the highest quality surge protection. We will install it correctly. You will be protected. If surges do breach the system, the protected equipment will be repaired or replaced because it is backed by an industry-leading manufacturer's warranty.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Why do I need phone and cable TV protection?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Most people think lightning attacks a computer or TV only through the electrical outlet. Sometimes it does. But lightning can also enter your home through the phone or cable TV lines.</p>
      </section>
      <h3>Do I still need point of surge protection?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Our plans eliminate surges through electric lines and phone and cable lines (Premium plan only). However, surges may enter the home through other means, via a remote building (garage or workshop) electrically attached to the house, swimming pool pump, outdoor lights, etc. Because of this, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) recommends the additional use of power strips to enhance protection for sensitive electronic equipment.</p>
      </section>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <h4>Premium Surge Protection FAQs</h4>
      <h3>Is this a Lightning Protection System?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No, Premium Surge Protection will not prevent lightning from striking your home. No product on the market will prevent lightning from striking a home nor will any product protect against lightning damage. However, Premium Surge Protection will cover any protected equipment damaged by a lightning induced surge that enters the home through the electric service, telephone, cable/satellite lines causing the failure of the installed surge device.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Can this equipment be installed on any home?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>A. No, at this time the manufacturer only offers a 200 AMP and 400 AMP meter socket adapter. Other exclusions are apartments, farmsteads, and homes not individually metered.</p>
      </section>
      <h3>Do I have to be home for the installation?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No, unless your electric meter, cable TV or phone lines are inaccessible from outside. Your power, phone and cable TV will be disconnected for a brief period of time during installation. Electronic clocks will have to be reset after the installation is complete.</p>
