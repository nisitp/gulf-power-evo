      <p>Adding solar isn&apos;t always an option &mdash; maybe you rent, or just aren&apos;t ready to invest in rooftop panels. Whatever your reason, if you&apos;d still like to support renewable energy development, consider joining our Gulf Energy Share program. Your support will help us create a brighter and more sustainable future for Northwest Florida.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>For only $99 per year, your subscription means approximately 750 kilowatt-hours of energy from our Gulf Solar Energy Share facility will flow to the power grid. This energy will displace energy which would have otherwise been produced by our power plants. Sign up for a five-year subscription and it&apos;s only $89 a year.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Our unique program is designed to address your interest in supporting environmentally friendly renewable energy. You are not purchasing physical equipment (like solar panels), but rather subscribing to a new solar program designed to supply renewable energy to the grid on your behalf.</p>
          <p>The power produced from the community solar facility may not be specifically delivered to you but will displace power that would have been otherwise produced from traditional generating facilities. One subscription&apos; 750 kilowatt hours is enough energy to power five laptops in a year!</p>
          <p>Currently, there are 2,880 subscriptions available that will be awarded on a first come, first served basis. Once all subscriptions have been awarded, customers can sign up for a waiting list to be awarded subscriptions as they become available.</p>
          <p>Benefits of participating include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playing a major role in developing community solar in Northwest Florida</li>
            <li>Additional monthly bill credits (around $2-2.50) on your electric bill for every subscription</li>
            <li>Supporting solar without installing and maintaining equipment</li>
            <li>Contributing to the creation of local jobs and additional tax revenues in local communities (to build and support our Energy Share facilities)</li>
            <li>Promotional gifts and other recognition for being a solar pioneer</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>How to Participate</h3>
        <p>All Gulf Power residential, business, and industrial customers are eligible to participate in Gulf Solar Energy Share. The program has two components &mdash; an annual subscription fee and a monthly bill credit. The bill credit reimburses subscribers for the value of the energy produced by the solar facility.</p>

        <button class="feature-close-button"><span class="fa fa-times"></span></button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Complete the form below to reserve your own subscription to the Gulf Solar Energy Share program. A subscription fee will appear as a line item on your bill once the solar facility is operational. All that&apos;s required is an annual subscription charge &mdash; there are no installation fees or equipment maintenance costs. Customers who agree to a 5-year commitment (<a href="/pdfs/solar/SolarEnergyShare-TermsAndConditions.pdf" target="_blank" >Participation Agreement</a> required) will receive a discounted subscription of $89.</p>
          <p>Note: It may be 2017 before Gulf Solar Energy Share is operational. Developing Northwest Florida&apos;s first community solar program takes time as Gulf Power&apos;s renewable energy team works to refine the program for our customers. Construction of the solar facility has begun with expected completion in the fall.</p>
          <p>At the conclusion of the first year of enrollment, you will automatically be enrolled for the following year and charged your annual $99 fee per subscription unless you provide a 30-day notice of your desire not to participate.</p>
          <p>Program subscriptions will be limited to a solar facility up to one megawatt in size, which will be owned and operated by Gulf Power in Milton, Fla. Subscriptions are limited and will be granted on a first come, first served basis. As the program grows, additional solar facilities may be installed in various areas around the region.</p>

    <h2>Gulf Solar Energy Share FAQs</h2>
    <h3>General Info</h3>

    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>Where is the Gulf Solar Energy Share solar facility located?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The first Energy Share facility will be located in Milton, FL off Highway 90 between the Industrial Park and the ball fields. Customers traveling from I-10 can go north on Highway 87 and turn right (east) on Highway 90. The first facility will be located on the north side of the highway, adjacent to the ball fields.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Will more facilities be built?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>If there is enough interest in the program, more facilities are built and more subscriptions will become available.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Do I get to choose how many subscriptions I want, or am I required to subscribe to a specific number?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Customers can purchase multiple subscriptions, but customer subscriptions are limited to 100% of their previous twelve months average energy use.</p>
        <p>Some customers, particularly business customers, may wish to subscribe to a larger number of subscriptions. They typically use more power than a residential customer, so more subscriptions may be appropriate.</p>
      </section>
    </div>

    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>If I am not a Gulf Power customer, can I still purchase subscriptions?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No. The program is only available to Gulf Power customers.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>What kind of paperwork is required for participation?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>To participate, customers only need to submit the application form on this page.</p>
        <p>Customers that want to take advantage of the reduced annual subscription fee of $89 for committing to a five-year subscription term will also need to sign a five-year participation agreement. The agreement will be emailed to the customer after receiving their subscription application and will be required to be signed and returned to Gulf Power prior to their subscription(s) becoming active. Participation agreements may be signed and returned electronically to the email that will be provided with the agreement.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>What if the project is fully subscribed?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Once the project is fully subscribed, interested customers will be placed on a waiting list and contacted when additional subscriptions become available.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>What if I want to buy more subscriptions later?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>As long as the subscriptions are not sold out, additional subscriptions may be available for purchase. Gulf Power is anticipating strong demand for this program, so we encourage customers to buy the right amount of subscriptions initially. If the program is sold out, your name will be added to a waiting list and you will be notified when more solar subscriptions become available.</p>
      </section>
    </div>

    <h3>Costs</h3>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>How much does it cost for one subscription? Is the cost ongoing? Will Gulf Power raise the cost?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Customers can subscribe on a yearly basis for $99 per subscription. A commitment of 5 years per subscription will reduce the price to $89 per year per subscription.</p>
        <p>Customers will be enrolled in automatic renewal for the following subscription term unless they opt-out at enrollment or if they contact Gulf Power at least 30 days prior to their subscription renewal.</p>
        <p>For subscribing customers WITHOUT automatic renewal, the customer will be sent a notice 60 days prior to the end of the subscription period. The customer must re-enroll at least 30 days prior to the end of the subscription period to keep their subscription active.</p>
        <p>The annual subscription fee will not increase over time.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Are there any other hidden fees?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>There are no additional fees. You only pay your subscription fee to participate! (Taxes and franchise fees may apply.)</p>

      <h3>What if a storm or hurricane damages the solar panels? What if it is really cloudy and the solar panels do not generate enough electricity? Will my monthly bill credit be lower?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The customer&apos;s monthly bill credits are based on an estimate of the annual renewable generation from the facility. Each year we re-evaluate how much solar will be generated and re-calculate the value of the credit.</p>
        <p>Estimates are great for the customer because they prevent fluctuation due to losses from random events like hurricanes or weather conditions.</p>
        <p>Customers can also expect their bill credits to change for each subscription year. As fuel/ gas prices go up, so will their monthly bill credit!</p>
        <p>Remember, damage to the solar array will not cause you to lose power at your home or business. You&apos;ll never have to worry about having enough energy at your home. Gulf Power will continue to meet all of your energy needs with other resources as long as there is no damage to the grid feeding your home.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Gulf Power will do everything we can to keep the solar panels well maintained and operational to maximize the bill credits you receive from your subscriptions.</p>

    <h3>Billing</h3>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>Do I still have to pay upfront for the subscription if I am on the waiting list?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Customers on the waiting list will not be charged until subscriptions become available and they are accepted into the program. Customers who are on the waiting list will be notified when subscriptions become available and will be charged for the subscription(s) automatically.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>How and when will Gulf Power collect my payment? And give me credits?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Annual subscription fees will not be billed until the initial facility is commercially operational. It may be 2017 before Gulf Solar Energy Share is operational. Developing Northwest Florida&apos;s first community solar program takes time as Gulf Power&apos;s renewable energy team works to refine the program for our customers. Monthly bill credits will begin the month following the billing of the annual fee and will continue for a period of twelve months.</p>
        <p>If automatically renewed, customers will be billed for their next annual subscription fee(s) twelve months from the date of their initial subscription fee(s) was billed.</p>
        <p>Customers with five-year commitments will also be billed annually for their number of annual subscriptions. They are NOT required to pay for all five years upfront.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>How is the monthly credit calculated?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Right now, the monthly bill credit is expected to be around $2 per subscription.</p>
        <p>The $2-$2.50 monthly credit is the estimated bill credit for 2016. The monthly credit will be recalculated each calendar year based on the amount of energy produced by the solar facility and the costs we avoid from not having to produce that amount of energy from our other power plants. Since solar has no fuel costs, the avoided cost of energy is savings mainly in fuel costs, which is savings passed on to subscribing customers through the monthly bill credit.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>The offset 750 kWh is at what rate?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>For every subscription we get for Gulf Solar Energy Share, we offset energy that we don&apos;t generate with a different type of fuel. That is around $0.03 per kilowatt-hour. The avoided cost of energy is savings that we see mainly in fuel costs, which is savings passed on to the subscribing customer. Right now the main fuel we use – natural gas – is very cheap, so avoided costs could change as fuel costs change.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>What happens to my subscription payment if I move prior to the expiration of my participation period?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Subscription payments are non-refundable. However, subscriptions and credits are portable. If a customer moves within Gulf Power&apos;s service area, the remaining monthly bill credits for the original subscription period will be credited to the customer&apos;s new account and the annual subscription fee schedule reinstated on the new account.</p>
        <p>If a customer moves out of the service territory, they will forfeit their initial subscription cost and monthly bill credits. Their subscription(s) will become available to the next customer on the waiting list after the original subscription expiration date for that year.</p>
        <p>Customers will not be permitted to transfer or assign subscriptions to third parties.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>What happens if I want to cancel my subscription(s)?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Subscription payments are non-refundable.</p>
        <p>If a customer elects to cancel their subscription(s) they will forfeit their future subscription(s) availability but will still receive the monthly bill credits for the remaining term applicable to their current subscriptions.</p>
        <p>For those customers who have signed a five-year participation agreement, their obligation to pay the annual subscription fee for each annual period during the term of the agreement is not subject to termination or cancellation by the customer. However, if the customer moves to a location outside of Gulf Power&apos;s service area and discontinues electric service with Gulf Power as a result, the customer shall be released from any obligation to pay Gulf Power for annual subscription fees which have yet to be billed to the customer during the remainder of the agreement term.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Are there any cancellation fees?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>There are no cancellation fees. However, for those customers who have signed a five-year participation agreement, a customer may not terminate or cancel their obligation to pay the annual subscription fee for the term of the agreement unless the customer moves to a location outside of Gulf Power&apos;s service area and discontinues electric service with Gulf Power.</p>
