    <h2>Learn More About Energy Efficient Windows</h2>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>Use this quick guide to better understand common product terms.</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Whether you would like to improve the energy performance of your existing windows or replace them with new energy-efficient windows, here are definitions for common product terms you may encounter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>U-Factor refers to the rate of heat loss; the lower the U-factor, the greater a window's resistance to heat flow and the better its insulating value</li>
          <li>Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) is the fraction of incident solar radiation admitted through a window; the lower the SHGC, the less solar heat it transmits</li>
          <li>Visible Transmittance (VT) tallies to the amount of visible light transmitted; the higher the VT, the more light is transmitted.</li>
          <li>Air Leakage (AL) is the amount of air passing through a square foot of window area (cfm/sf); the lower the AL, the less air will pass through cracks in the assembly.</li>
          <li>Condensation Resistance (CR) measures how well a window resists the formation of condensation on the inside surface; the higher the number, the better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Recommendations in the Southern Zone</em>: A low SHGC is the most important window property in warm climates. A low U-factor is useful but it is less important than SHGC in warm climates.</p>
