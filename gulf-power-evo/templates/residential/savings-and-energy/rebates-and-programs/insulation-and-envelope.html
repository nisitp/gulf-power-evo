      <p>You might not even notice, but air and heat can needlessly escape your home through holes, leaks, and improper sealing. It adds up to wasted energy and a higher power bill.</p>
      <p>Your home&apos;s heating and cooling system rely on a well-constructed and insulated envelope and duct system to keep it working efficiently. We offer advice &mdash; and rebate opportunities &mdash; to help you keep your home comfortable year-round.</p>

            <p>Advanced techniques for sealing holes and cracks in a home's "thermal envelope" and HVAC ducts greatly improve comfort and indoor air quality. A tightly sealed system keeps warm and cool air in the home while keeping allergens, moisture and pests out.</p>
            <p>You can have your home inspected to determine if you would benefit from an envelope retrofit, but it is best to build in energy efficiency from the start.</p>
            <p>EarthCents Home meets or exceed the specifications of nationally-recognized efficiency programs by offering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Solid framework &mdash; tightly constructed, sealed and pressure tested</li>
              <li>All insulation in full contact with a rigid air-barrier material</li>
              <li>HVAC duct system pressure balanced and tested</li>

            <h3 class="story-tile-title">Efficient and Effective Insulation</h3>
            <p>Properly installed insulation in your envelope spaces (such as attics and walls) and around your duct system protects your indoor comfort and keeps the outdoors out.  It's not enough to simply have the right amount of insulation in your home. It must be installed without any gaps, voids or compressions. Anything short of this means your cooling and heating system may be forced to work overtime, leading to higher energy bills.</p>
            <p>With properly installed insulation, you get:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Comfortable, consistent and even temperatures throughout your house</li>
              <li>More efficient operation of your cooling and heating equipment, resulting in lower energy bills</li>
              <li>A quieter home with higher resale value</li>
            </ul>

              <h3 class="story-tile-title">Benefits of Properly Installed Duct Systems</h3>
              <p>The control and distribution of heated and cooled air in your home is carried out by the duct system. A properly installed duct system helps you live comfortably while using energy efficiently.</p>
              <p>Locating ductwork during construction in conditioned versus unconditioned areas of the home can result in savings of more than 20% in heating and cooling costs. If you&apos;re installing a duct system in your home, it should be designed by an accredited professional using industry-recognized procedures. We&apos;ll be glad to double-check for you.</p>
              <p>Repairing duct leaks in existing homes can result in heating and cooling savings of as much as 30%. That's a big savings for a problem that's inexpensive to locate and repair. Our contractors can assess your system and determine if you qualify for repairs.</p>

      <h3>Duct System Installation Design</h3>
      <section>
        <p>We recommend the following insulation specifications to ensure high efficiency and low operating costs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use at least <span class="important-info">R-6 duct wrap</span> on all ducts. If construction design permits, install ducts inside the conditioned area.</li>
          <li>Seal all joints with duct mastic, duct mastic tape or the equivalent.</li>
          <li>Install <span class="important-info">R-30 to R-38 attic insulation</span> on as much of the system as possible.</li>
          <li>Select mechanical equipment with a minimum Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER) of 14.0.</li>
          <li>Insulate heater closet and caulk all seams to avoid drawing air in from the attic or unconditioned areas.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Duct System Upgrade Recommendations</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Look for ductwork leaks in the air-handling unit and between the following components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individual sections of ductwork</li>
          <li>Ductwork and boots</li>
          <li>Registers</li>
          <li>Ductwork and plenums</li>
          <li>Ductwork and return-air chamber</li>
          <li>Air-handling unit and plenums</li>
          <li>Support platform and return-air chamber</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend the following insulation specifications if you are upgrading your duct system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Install a minimum of R-6 duct wrap to uninsulated ducts and tape all joints.</li>
          <li>Mastic or seal all joints between ducts, supply plenum and heat pump and insulate against heat transfer.</li>
          <li>Seal heater closet paying special attention to pipes and wires that pass through walls.</li>
          <li>Seal off heater closet from the attic so the system can't draw unconditioned air from that area.</li>
          <li>Upgrade attic insulation to R-38 and cover as much of the duct system as possible.</li>
        </ul>
