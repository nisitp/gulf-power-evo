        <h3>Residential Service Variable Price (RSVP) Rate</h3>
        <p>Our special variable price is the cornerstone of the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> program. The RSVP rate gives you the opportunity to pay a lower price for the electricity consumed in your household 87% of the time.</p>

          <h3>RSVP Rate Details</h3>
          <p>The RSVP rate features four variable prices that are based upon the time of day and time of week, with time periods that vary by season (summer and winter). It is designed so that you and your family can save money by using the bulk of your energy during the low and medium periods, when you will be paying less than the standard residential rate.</p>
          <p>That means with Energy <span class="select">Select</span>, the price you pay for electricity is lower than the standard residential rate 87% of the time.</p>
