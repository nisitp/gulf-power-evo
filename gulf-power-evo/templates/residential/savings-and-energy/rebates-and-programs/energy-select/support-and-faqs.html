    <h2>Pricing Periods/Rates/Fees</h2>

    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>What are the rates, terms and conditions of the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> program?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customers are on the Residential Service Variable Pricing or (RSVP) rate. <a href="/residential/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/energy-select#rsvp-rate-section">Learn more about the RSVP rate schedule</a>. In order to participate, you must be a current Gulf Power customer on the standard residential rate (not FlatBill). Your home must have a properly working central cooling and heating system AND Broadband internet service with available secure WiFi. In addition, you must be the homeowner or have the homeowner&apos;s permission to have equipment installed at the premise.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How much is installation of the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> equipment at my home?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Installation is free.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>If I want to discontinue Energy <span class="select">Select</span>, is there a removal fee?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>There is no fee to remove the system. We highly encourage you to remain on the program for at least one year. Savings are realized annually. If you discontinue at the end of the summer, you cannot benefit from the generous winter savings.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>When is the high price charged?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>May – October</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1:00 p.m.–6:00 p.m., Weekdays (not including holidays)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>November - April</p>
        <ul>
          <li>6:00 a.m.–10:00 a.m., Weekdays (not including holidays)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Can I pre-cool or pre-heat my home before a higher price period?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Yes. You can pre-cool or pre-heat your home during a lower price period so that the temperature remains comfortable during the higher price period.  With easy programming from the Customer Engagement Portal, you can have all your settings in place.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What is the critical price period?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The critical price period is considered when Gulf Power&apos;s generating capacity has reached conditions for maximum demand of electricity. The critical price period is not fixed, but is determined by Gulf Power as needed.  Critical pricing periods will never exceed 1% of total hours in a year.  However, you can plan for this price by programming your system to respond accordingly when the critical price signal is sent. You never have to be at home to respond to any price. Once your programs are set, the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> system does the work for you. And if you need to make a quick fix to settings, you can login to the Customer Engagement Portal from a computer or mobile device anytime, anywhere to change your programming online.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How will I know when the critical price is in effect?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Your Energy <span class="select">Select</span> thermostat is equipped with an indicator light to warn you of an upcoming critical price period, as well as let you know when a critical price is in effect. (See your customer guide for specific details regarding your thermostat&apos;s indicator light operation.) In addition, you can sign up for an electronic notification.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Can a critical price period occur during the weekend?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>While a critical price can take place any time, it typically will occur on a weekday, during the High price period.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What happens with the price on observed holidays?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>There is no High price in effect on observed holidays, which include Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year&apos;s Day. The High price will be replaced with the Medium price on these days, mirroring the weekend schedule.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How often does the RSVP price change?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The base rates will only change when all other rates change. The fuel cost will change typically once a year in January. The summer and winter seasonal period changes occur on May 1 and Nov. 1. It is the responsibility of the customer to be aware that the pricing periods change each May and November and adjust their programming accordingly. Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customers will receive a season change postcard, the week prior to price period modification, as a reminder to reset programmed settings. In addition, you can sign up for an electronic notification.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Can a customer be on both Energy <span class="select">Select</span> and the Flat Bill rate?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>No. The price you pay for electricity is different on these two rates. Therefore, you cannot be on both rates at the same time.</p>

    <h2>Maximizing Savings</h2>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>Do I have to change my lifestyle to be an Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customer?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The benefit of having the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> smart thermostat and timers for your appliances is that you don&apos;t have to change your lifestyle. Once you enter your customized program based on your schedule and desired price response, you don&apos;t have to think about it again. The Energy <span class="select">Select</span> system will automatically do all the work for you, saving energy and your money.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>If I&apos;m typically home during the high price period, am I a good candidate for Energy <span class="select">Select</span>?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>People at home during the high price period (weekdays) can shift the operation of their system with minimal to no impact on their activities. For cooling and heating, you can pre-heat or pre-cool before a higher price period begins, and then minimize consumption during the high price period. In fact, 96 percent say that they are satisfied or very satisfied with the comfort level of their home.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What&apos;s the easiest way to maximize savings with Energy <span class="select">Select</span>?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The easiest way to maximize your savings is by simply minimizing your usage during the high price period. By programming your thermostat, water heater and pool pump to avoid usage for the majority of the high price period, you will save money.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Do I have to use electricity primarily in the low price period to save money?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>No. Both the low price and the medium price are lower than the standard residential rate and these two price periods are in effect 87 percent of the time.</p>

    <h2>Program and Equipment</h2>
    <div class="faqs">
      <h3>What type of communication is compatible with Energy <span class="select">Select</span>?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>For new customers to the program, broadband internet service with secure WiFi is required.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What do I do if my WiFi Network and Password change?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Whenever your WiFi credentials change, you will need to update the Network and Password for the Energy <span class="select">Select</span>.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What is &ldquo;broadband internet service&rdquo;?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Broadband internet service refers to internet service that is delivered via a &ldquo;broadband&rdquo; as opposed to older dial-up service through a phone line.  Broadband literally means the method of delivery has greater bandwidth, allowing for the flow of larger amounts of data at faster speeds.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Why do I have to maintain compatible communications in order to have Energy <span class="select">Select</span>?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Communication is a key component of the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> program and must be maintained for the system to work as effectively as possible.  Stable communication ensures programming is followed, pricing signals are received and season changes are initiated.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Why do I need Energy <span class="select">Select</span>? Can&apos;t I save just as much with a regular programmable thermostat?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>If you are not an Energy <span class="select">Select</span> customer, the price you pay for electricity is the same 24 hours a day. Only as an Energy <span class="select">Select</span> participant do you get lower prices during certain time periods throughout the day and week. The Energy <span class="select">Select</span> smart thermostat is no ordinary thermostat. It has a price-response feature that allows you to program it to automatically respond to the price of electricity in effect at any given time. The only way you can get a thermostat that gives you this level of control over your electricity and monthly bill is through the Energy <span class="select">Select</span> program.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How long will the thermostat hold my program in the event of a power outage?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Since your programming is stored in memory, it is maintained through any length of power outage. The thermostat will not have to be reprogrammed after an outage.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How do I know if I&apos;m eligible for Energy <span class="select">Select</span>?</h3>
      <div>
        <p><a href="/residential/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/energy-select#energy-select-sign-up">Click here</a> to check the eligibility requirements for Energy <span class="select">Select</span> participation.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Why did Gulf Power Company develop this program?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>It costs Gulf Power significantly more to produce electricity in high demand periods. Energy <span class="select">Select</span> was developed to encourage customers to shift a portion of their electricity purchases from the higher priced peak demand periods to the lower priced demand periods to save money. Therefore, since Energy <span class="select">Select</span> lowers demand in the peak periods, it benefits Gulf Power Company and all ratepayers by helping to defer the cost of building new facilities to meet growing demand, and consequently, rates can remain lower for everyone. It&apos;s a win-win for customers and Gulf Power.</p>
