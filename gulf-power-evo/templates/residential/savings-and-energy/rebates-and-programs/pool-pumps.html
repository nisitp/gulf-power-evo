      <p>We love our swimming pools, and the entertainment they provide. However, if you have a swimming pool, chances are you have a higher-than-average energy bill. Your pool&apos;s pump and heater can use a significant amount of energy. Let us help you create a high efficiency pool with smart equipment and habits.</p>

          <p>Pool pumps can use a significant amount of energy. A typical one horsepower pump often runs for 12 hours each day; that could cost about $50 per month. Variable-speed pumps from ENERGY STAR only use the required amount of energy to keep your pool ready for swimming, saving you money each month.

          <h3 class="story-tile-title">Try Heating Your Pool a New Way</h3>
          <p>Gas pool heaters can cost over $1,000 a year in energy bills. Energy efficient pool heat pumps can do the same job for less than half that amount. </p>
          <p>As your pool&apos;s water is circulated through its pool pump, the heat pump compresses energy that is absorbed from the sun&apos;s free heat and transfers it back to warm the pool. You&apos;ll spend less to keep your pool at 80 to 90 degrees year-round, making a heat pump the most efficient and cost-effective way to heat your pool. </p>

      <p>Small adjustments can create big savings. Other ideas for making your pool more efficient include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce the filtration time to 6 hours per day. If the water doesn&apos;t appear clean, increase the time in half-hour increments until it does.</li>
        <li>Install a timer to control the pump&apos;s cycling. If debris is a problem, use a timer that can activate the pump for many short periods each day. </li>
      </ul>
