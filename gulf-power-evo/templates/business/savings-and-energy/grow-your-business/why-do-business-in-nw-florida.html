      <h3>A Highly Connected Transportation Hub</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Northwest Florida is a natural transportation hub served by an excellent transportation system including air, rail and deep water shipping. The region is ideally situated, as close to a major midwestern market such as St. Louis as it is to Miami. By rail or truck, Memphis, Washington, D.C. or Dallas, are all within a two-day reach. Atlanta, Jacksonville and New Orleans are just a day away.</p>
        <p>An extensive highway system of primary Interstate and regional highways make Northwest Florida one of the best trucking regions in the United States. The industry is deregulated, often lowering costs. More trucking freight enters Florida than exits, resulting in more favorable outward bound rates.</p>
        <p>The rail system provides service to the entire eastern half of the United States and single system traffic to the Pacific Northwest. Spurs are also available to many of the region&apos;s industrial parks, including full-service to the ports of Pensacola and Panama City.</p>
        <p>Several major air carriers serve the region. With three commercial airports, your corporation is within minutes of passenger, air freight and express service, plus other private and executive air travel facilities.</p>
        <p>Pensacola and Panama City are the sites of two deep water ports with dockside facilities. Each year, two million tons of imports and exports pass through the ports. Sixty steamship lines utilize our waterway system. The Gulf Intercoastal Waterway provides access to barge traffic, connecting with the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway and the Mississippi River farther west.</p>
        <p>Northwest Florida&apos;s geography puts your corporation in the best logistical position of any Southeastern corporate site.</p>
