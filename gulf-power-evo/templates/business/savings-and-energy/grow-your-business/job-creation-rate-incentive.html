      <p>We give new qualifying businesses base rate electric price incentives over a four-year period. The potential savings may range from $11,000 for a 200-kilowatt business customer to more than $1.2 million for a 4-megawatt customer. To learn more, and to sign up, see below.</p>

    <h2>How Much Will My Business Save?</h2>
    <p>How much businesses save each year through our Job Creation Rate depends on their electricity load size, and which year of the program they&apos;re in. There are three incentive electric load categories &mdash; 200 to 349 kW, 350 to 999 kW and 1,000 kW or greater.</p>
