          <h3 class="story-tile-title">Demand Pricing</h3>
          <p>Our standard commercial and industrial rates: you get the energy you want, when you want it. Several factors are calculated into demand rates: the amount of power used and how quickly it is used. If yours is a business that has to be open during standard weekday working hours, and uses energy for heating, cooling, and lighting, then a Demand Rate is probably right for you. There are several classes of Demand Rates, depending on your type of business, energy needs and other factors.</p>

          <h3 class="story-tile-title">Time of Use Pricing</h3>
          <p>This rate benefits customers with certain load patterns or those who have the flexibility to shift usage to off-peak periods. If your business can operate during the evenings, nights or weekends, or if your business experiences its heaviest energy usage during those times you could realize considerable savings with Time of Use Rates. There are several classes of Time of Use Rates: contact us to discuss the best plan for you.</p>
