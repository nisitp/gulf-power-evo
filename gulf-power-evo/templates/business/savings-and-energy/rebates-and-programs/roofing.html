      <p>Certain roofing materials reflect the sun's heat back to the sky instead of transferring it to the building below. ENERGY STAR-qualified roof products reflect more of the sun's rays and can lower roof surface temperature significantly which means your air conditioner is not working as hard, reducing its workload by 10-15 percent. And you can save with incentives up to $5,000 to businesses that use qualifying roof products.</p>

  <h2>About Cool Roofs</h2>
  <div>
    <section class="text-section">
      <p>Cool roof materials reflect and emit the sun&apos;s heat back to the sky instead of absorbing it. &ldquo;Coolness&rdquo; is measured by two properties, solar reflectance and thermal emittance. The higher the value for each property, the cooler the roof.</p>
      <p>Cool roof owners may notice an increase in their heating costs in winter months. This increase is usually greatly outweighed by the cooling energy savings achieved during summer months. </p>
