    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Our commercial surge solution includes a device that creates a defense between powerful lightning-induced and related surges and your electric motor-driven equipment or resistance heating appliances.</p>
      <p>The device is manufactured by TESCO, a leader in heavy-duty surge protection. The device does not limit normal electrical flow, but it does provide a clamping, or limiting, action in case of a voltage surge preventing damage to critical equipment such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HVAC compressors</li>
        <li>Refrigerator and freezer compressors</li>
        <li>Cooking equipment</li>
        <li>Gasoline pump motors</li>
        <li>Healthcare-related equipment and more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: This solution is designed exclusively to protect electrical motor-driven equipment, resistance heating elements and the electronic circuit boards associated with the specific piece of equipment. To further safeguard your sensitive electronics, such as computers and copiers, be sure to place an additional surge protector at each point of use.</p>

      <h3>If the surge equipment breaks, who repairs it?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>An authorized Gulf Power electrical technician will replace the surge protection device if it is damaged.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>I have power strips to protect my equipment. Why do I need this device?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The Surge Protector used in this program has been tested to meet utility standards and is designed to protect your large motor-driven and resistance heat equipment and appliances, where strips cannot typically be used. It also comes with an industry leading manufacturer's warranty.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Why should I have to pay for surge protection?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>We are very confident in the quality of power we are able to deliver to your business. However, there are many things that can happen on power lines that are beyond our control. Surges can be caused by things like lightning, cut power lines that take out transformers, or the stopping and starting of manufacturing equipment.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Will the charge appear as a separate line item on my bill?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Yes, the monthly charge will appear as a line item on your monthly Gulf Power bill.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>When does the warranty take effect?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The manufacturer's warranty coverage for surge protection goes into effect when the surge suppression equipment has been installed.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Will you replace any perishables in my freezer if I lose any equipment due to a surge?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No. The manufacturer's warranty only covers the actual damage to the equipment and not any collateral damage that may result due to a failed suppressor.</p>
        <p>(Please see <a href="/###pdfs/gulf_warranty.pdf" target="_blank" >complete manufacturer warranty</a> for specific details.)</p>
      </section>

      <h3>If I have Commercial Surge, will the manufacturer's warranty pay for downtime at my business?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No. The manufacturer's warranty only covers the actual damage to the equipment and does not cover any collateral damage that may result due to a failed suppressor.</p>
        <p>(Please see <a href="/###pdfs/gulf_warranty.pdf" target="_blank" >complete manufacturer warranty</a> for specific details.)</p>
      </section>

      <h3>If the surge protection device fails, will I know &mdash; and will Gulf Power replace it?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The surge suppression device comes with red LED indicator lights that are lit while active. If those lights are out, the surge equipment has been damaged and is not working. If a failed unit is discovered on our routine checks, we will replace it at no charge to you.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Will my business need to be without electrical service to install the device?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Typically, no, but under some circumstances we will need to momentarily cut your power. Before we do, our installers schedule a convenient time for installation with your business.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Do I still need point-of-use surge protection?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Commercial Surge protects motor-driven and resistance-based equipment and their electronic components. In order to protect other electronics like computers, Gulf Power recommends a good, high quality point-of-use surge device.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Is this a lightning protection system?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No, Commercial Surge Protection will not prevent lightning from striking your business. However, Commercial Surge Protection will protect against any lightning related surges and cover any protected motor-driven equipment damaged by a lightning-induced or related surge entering your business through the electric service.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>Does the surge suppression equipment protect against single phasing conditions?</h3>
      <section>
        <p>No. In order to protect equipment in the event of a single phasing condition, a customer should install special equipment designed specifically for this purpose.</p>
