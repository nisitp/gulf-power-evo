      <p>Energy costs can make up a significant portion of your overhead. Considering that a significant amount of your energy dollar goes to heating and cooling, adding insulation may be the most cost-effective energy improvement you can make. You can also earn back money &mdash; up to $1,500 &mdash; through our incentive program.</p>
