    <p>Check out these tips to help you stay comfortable and use your electricity efficiently at the same time.</p>

    <div class="faqs">
      <h4>Lighting</h4>
      <h3>Consider these tips to save money and energy on lighting.</h3>
      <section>
        <p>1. Exit signs</p>
        <p>Switch to ENERGY STAR&reg; LED models. Exit signs remain on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which makes this measure more cost effective.</p>

        <p>2. Interior Lighting Controls</p>
        <p>Install sensors to control lighting systems where applicable. Determining if daylighting controls, dimmers, occupancy or vacancy sensors are the right strategy for your building is important. Choosing the ideal type of sensor is also essential.</p>

        <p>3. Interior lighting</p>
        <p>In many cases, upgrading to LED technology makes economic sense, as in recent years, lamp and labor costs to have these installed have dropped significantly.</p>

        <p>4. Exterior lighting</p>
        <p>Consider replacing outdoor lighting with LEDs. <a href="/business/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/outdoor-lighting">Click here</a> to learn more about our outdoor lighting services.</p>

        <p>5. Photocells</p>
        <p>Installing automatic controls for exterior lighting has become an industry standard even for existing buildings as installation costs are predominately low.</p>

      <h4>HVAC</h4>
      <h3>HVAC is at the top of all energy end-use consumption, making it a great place to focus on savings.</h3>
      <section>
        <p>1. Programmable thermostats</p>
        <p>Installing programmable thermostats to conserve energy by controlling building temperatures is a simple and effective method to save energy.</p>

        <p>2. Demand-controlled ventilation</p>
        <p>Install demand-controlled ventilation devices on existing ventilation systems. In hot-humid climates, limiting outside air to only what is required could yield great savings.</p>

        <p>3. Insulation</p>
        <p>Adding ceiling insulation can help lower the heating and cooling costs for your business. <a href="/business/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/insulation">Click here</a> to learn more about available incentives.</p>

        <p>4. Roofing</p>
        <p>Reflect the sun's heat back to the sky instead of transferring it to the building below with ENERGY STAR&reg; qualified roof products. <a href="/business/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/roofing">Click here</a> to learn more about available incentives.</p>

        <p>5. HVAC repair or upgrade</p>
        <p>Make a big impact on your costs by improving the efficiency of your existing systems or upgrading to new equipment with a higher efficiency rating.</p>
        <p><a href="/business/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/heating-and-cooling">Click here</a> to learn more about available incentives or <a href="/business/savings-and-energy/rebates-and-programs/find-a-CheckMe-contractor">find a CheckMe!&reg; Plus Contractor</a> who can assess your system to see if you qualify for rebates.</p>

      <h4>Plug Loads</h4>
      <h3>Manage your computers and office appliances efficiently.</h3>
      <section>
        <p>1. Office Equipment</p>
        <p>Consolidate your Printer, copier, fax, and scanner to an all-in-one ENERGY STAR&reg; model with hibernation mode capabilities.</p>

        <p>2. Vending machines</p>
        <p>These machines stay on 24/7. Switching to ENERGY STAR&reg; models and using more energy efficient lighting with timers or occupancy sensors can provide substantial savings.</p>

        <p>3. Computers</p>
        <p>Switch to ENERGY STAR&reg; certified models which are sleep-mode-enabled.</p>

        <p>4. Computer Monitors</p>
        <p>Switch to ENERGY STAR&reg; certified models which are sleep-mode-enabled.</p>
